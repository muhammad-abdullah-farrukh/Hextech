Stages 9 & 10 — KG Construction + RDF Parsing + Entity Resolution + Provenance.

Stage 9: LLM generates a list of facts from (doc, QA pairs, ontology)
Stage 10: facts are validated against the ontology and assembled into a
          graph deterministically; rdflib serializes the final Turtle.

WHY THIS VERSION LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY PREVIOUS ATTEMPT:
  Every previous failure (Douglas Adams leak, `a wikibase:Property`
  redeclaration, "wikibase : Property" spacing bugs, undeclared prefixes,
  prose leaking into Turtle on retry) was a symptom of the same root cause:
  asking an 8B instruct model to hand-write punctuation-sensitive RDF/Turtle
  syntax. Tightening the prompt and adding retries made it *somewhat*
  better, then a hotter retry made it catastrophically worse (full English
  sentences spliced into the "Turtle" output).

  The fix is not a better prompt. It's removing the model's ability to
  emit syntax at all:
    - The model now outputs a JSON array of plain facts: subject,
      predicate (must be one of the ontology's property labels), object,
      and whether the object is an entity or a literal. JSON is a task
      8B instruct models handle far more reliably than Turtle.
    - Every fact is validated against the ontology's actual predicate set
      IN CODE before it is ever allowed into the graph. A predicate that
      isn't declared in the ontology is dropped, not "discouraged by
      prompt wording". `a wikibase:Property` style redeclaration is
      structurally impossible now — there's no Turtle syntax for the
      model to misuse, because the model never writes Turtle.
    - rdflib builds the graph and serializes it. The model never
      generates @prefix lines, never writes a colon, never produces a
      malformed statement — it just lists facts.
    - Retries stay at LOW, FIXED temperature with specific error feedback
      (e.g. "predicate X is not in the ontology, use one of: Y, Z").
      Escalating temperature is exactly what caused the worst failure
      seen so far, so it's gone.

  UPDATE (Ollama migration): guided_json is NOT enforced under Ollama's
  native /api/chat endpoint the way it was under vLLM — Ollama silently
  ignores the request (see the "[llm] guided_json ... ignoring" warning
  printed at call time). This means the model is now free to wrap its
  JSON in markdown fences, add prose before/after it, or get truncated
  mid-array if max_tokens is too small — none of which json.loads()
  tolerates on its own. _parse_facts() now strips markdown wrapping and
  attempts to repair a truncated array before giving up, instead of
  assuming the raw response is always clean JSON.

  UPDATE (chunking — root cause #1 follow-up): raising CQ_SAFETY_MAX in
  Stage 1 (40 -> 100) stopped CQs 41-77 being thrown away before Stage 2
  ever ran, but it made the *existing* problem here worse: this stage was
  already truncating the QA block via _guard_context() to fit one 12K-ish
  char prompt, and doubling the QA volume just meant more of it got cut
  before generate_facts() ever saw it. On top of that, even QA pairs that
  DID survive were all extracted in a single flat LLM call with a single
  implicit subject — which produced ambiguous graphs (e.g. four
  undifferentiated start dates with no way to tell which job/degree each
  one belongs to), since the model had to invent and re-remember subject
  names across one huge context.

  Fix: instead of one generate_facts() call over the whole QA list, QA
  pairs are now grouped into chunks by the "subject" field Stage 1
  attaches to every CQ (and Stage 2 passes through unchanged onto every
  QA pair) — see stage1_cq_gen.py's fix log. Each chunk gets its own
  generate_facts() call with a small, focused QA block that comfortably
  fits in context, plus a subject_hint telling the model which entity
  every fact in that batch is about — so it doesn't have to infer or
  re-remember subject identity across a large flat prompt. Per-chunk
  graphs are merged with rdflib's Graph.__add__ before serialization.
  _guard_context() is kept as a per-chunk safety net (chunks are sized to
  rarely need it, but a single subject with an unusually large number of
  QA pairs could still exceed MAX_PROMPT_CHARS on its own).

  An earlier version of this fix tried to *infer* the grouping by
  regexing over each question's wording (e.g. matching "... at X"). That
  was rejected: it only worked as well as the model's phrasing habits
  happened to cooperate, and degraded silently on any document phrased
  differently. Grouping now reads a field that was decided once, at the
  source, using a controlled output format — no natural-language guessing
  anywhere in this stage. QA pairs with subject="_unlabeled" (Stage 1
  failed to tag them, or the QA file predates tagging) are each treated
  as their own singleton chunk rather than guessed into a group — see
  _chunk_qa_pairs() below.

Post-generation pipeline (unchanged from before):
  1. Entity resolution — every wd: entity URI is resolved through the 3-tier
     resolver (gazetteer → embedding → LLM) and rewritten to its canonical form.
  2. Provenance — every accepted triple gets a ProvenanceRecord stored to
     outputs/provenance/{doc_name}.json with source doc, stage, timestamp,
     confidence, and model version.

- "predicate" MUST be copied exactly from the ontology list below. If no
  property in the ontology fits a fact, skip that fact — do not invent
  a new predicate name and do not use a property name that isn't listed.
- "subject" and "object" are plain human-readable text (e.g. "Air
  University Islamabad"), never URIs, never prefixed names, never RDF
  syntax of any kind.
- object_type is "entity" when the object is a named thing (a person,
  organization, place, institution, tool, framework, project) and
  "literal" when it's a free-text value, date, level, or description
  (e.g. a degree title, a language proficiency level, a description).
- Only include facts that are actually supported by the document and
