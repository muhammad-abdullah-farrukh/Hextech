"""
Stages 7 & 8 — Ontology creation logic + OWL/Turtle formatting.

Stage 7: decide which properties make it into the ontology
  - Wikidata match         → add Wikidata property
  - EDC canon store match  → reuse previously generated Turtle (no new LLM call)
  - No match + SCHEMA_EXPANSION=True  → LLM generates Turtle, registered in EDC store
  - No match + SCHEMA_EXPANSION=False → discard

Stage 8: format into Turtle (OWL)
  - Matched props (Wikidata or canon): use known Turtle
  - New props: LLM infers domain/range (verbatim prompt from paper)

Ontology quality validation:
  - Each LLM-generated Turtle block is validated with rdflib before being
    added; invalid blocks are dropped with a diagnostic instead of silently
    corrupting Stage 9's input.
  - Full assembled ontology is validated before returning; the pipeline
    fails fast with a clear error if the result is not parseable.

Dedup note (fixed):
  Stage 6 intentionally returns one match result per ORIGINAL relation
  occurrence (e.g. if 13 different CQ-derived relations all resolved to the
  same Wikidata property, that property appears 13 times in match_results —
  this is correct and documented behaviour for stage 6, since callers need
  a 1:1 mapping back to their source relations).
  Previously, build_ontology() only deduplicated the SCHEMA_EXPANSION
  "new property" branch (via seen_new_props) and NOT the Wikidata-match or
  canon-match branches, so a property matched 13 times would get 13
  duplicate `wdt:X a wikibase:Property ; ...` blocks written into the
  ontology. This bloats the ontology text fed into Stage 9's prompt with
  pure noise and increases the chance of the LLM echoing a property name
  back incorrectly. Fixed by deduplicating the Wikidata-match branch by
  `pid` and the canon-match branch by the rendered Turtle text, mirroring
  the existing seen_new_props pattern.

AUDIT NOTE (this pass):
  Verified against an actual pipeline run (farrukh_result1v2.zip):
  outputs/ontology/yourfile.ttl — the file this module's run() actually
  writes — came out with exactly 9 unique property blocks, correctly
  deduped by pid, matching the 9 real facts in the source CV (the CV also
  produced 31 duplicate "project name" relations that all correctly
  collapsed into a single WorkingTitle block). The dedup logic in this file
  is working as intended.

  However, a SEPARATE file, outputs/ontology/ontology.ttl, was found in the
  same run with 124 lines and properties like DataAnalysisMethod duplicated
  14 times. Nothing in this module writes to a file called "ontology.ttl"
  (only "{doc_name}.ttl") — that file must be produced by something else in
  the pipeline (a corpus-level merge step, a different stage, or a stale
  artifact from before this dedup fix existed). The duplication bug
  reported earlier is real, but it is not in this file — track it down in
  whatever script writes outputs/ontology/ontology.ttl (pipeline.py is the
  likely candidate).

PATCH NOTE (this pass) — bare-PID local names for LLM-minted properties:
  Root cause traced to _new_prop_turtle(): new (non-Wikidata) properties are
  minted via a single freeform LLM call that is trusted to invent BOTH the
  URI local name and the rdfs:label together. For most properties the model
  followed the one worked example in NEW_PROP_PROMPT and produced a
  CamelCase slug (courseName, Achievements, PerformancePercentage). For two
  properties ("duration", "presentation title") it instead free-associated
  to real-looking Wikidata PIDs (wdt:P39, wdt:P1) as the local name while
  still writing a human-readable rdfs:label — producing a block where the
  URI and label disagree. _ontology_predicate_map() in stage9_10_kg.py
  builds its valid-predicate list from the URI local name, not rdfs:label,
  so Stage 9's LLM was told the only valid name for "duration of role" was
  the meaningless token "P39" and correctly refused to use it — silently
  dropping every duration/date-range fact and the presentation title fact
  from the final graph.
  This is inherently non-deterministic (LLM word choice), not a
  deterministic fallback bug, so it can recur for any newly-minted property
  on any run. Fixed two ways:
    1. NEW_PROP_PROMPT now explicitly forbids bare Wikidata-style IDs
       (P123-style tokens) as the local name.
    2. _new_prop_turtle() now defensively post-processes the LLM's output:
       if the minted local name matches ^P\\d+$ (or any other non-descriptive
       token that doesn't resemble a slug of the label), it is rewritten to
       a CamelCase slug derived from rdfs:label before validation — mirroring
       the label/URI consistency that _wikidata_turtle() already guarantees
       by construction. This closes the gap regardless of what the LLM
       outputs, rather than relying solely on the prompt instruction.

Use the relations (properties) and their usage comments to

Infer and summarize classes for domain and range of the

classes to relations only if required for closure of relations.

For each relation, add relevant ontology entry for it.

Add rdfs:comment based on the usage comments.

Use wdt: namespace for all relations discovered. Use entities
under these prefixes if necessary:
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .

Use turtle syntax.

IMPORTANT — naming the property's local URI name (the part after "wdt:"):
- The local name MUST be a CamelCase or camelCase slug derived from the
  relation's label (e.g. label "duration of role" -> wdt:DurationOfRole,
  label "course name" -> wdt:courseName).
- NEVER use a bare numeric/alphanumeric code such as wdt:P39 or wdt:P1,
  even if it superficially looks like a real Wikidata property ID. This is
  a NEW, locally-minted property, not an existing Wikidata property, so it
  must never be given a Wikidata-style "P<number>" identifier.
- The local name and the rdfs:label must obviously correspond to each
  other — do not invent a code-like name that a reader could not derive
  from the label.

Below is an example:
####
Relations:
(results, results: results of a competition such as sports or elections)

wdt:Results a wikibase:Property ;
    schema:description "results of a competition such as sports or elections" ;
